1. Installing or upgrading the software
---------------------------------------

You must be logged-in as privileged user (administrator, root)
to perform the installation, which is very simple and can be
done within seconds. Here are the basic steps you want to do:

 i. Create directory on a filesystem with enough free space to hold
    the software and working data (backup/archive indices, etc).

 i. Uncompress and unpack the distribution tarball in this directory

 i. Start the software with "start-server" script. 

For Macintosh and Windows distributions, those steps are performed
automatically by the provided installer/package program.
The installer automatically selects "/usr/local/aw" (Unices, Mac) 
or "C:\Program Files\ARCHIWARE\Data_Lifecycle_Management_Suite" (Windows)
as the installation directory and puts the application server on the port 
8000 (http) and 8443 (https).

Following is a short example for some supported platforms:

  ### For Linux servers (assumes "/media/cdrom" CD-ROM mount point):

  mkdir -p /usr/local/aw
  cd /usr/local/aw
  tar xzf /media/cdrom/server/unix/awpstXYZ.tgz
  ./start-server

  ### For Sun Solaris servers (assumes auto-mounted CD-ROM):

  mkdir -p /usr/local/aw
  cd /usr/local/aw
  gunzip < /cdrom/cdrom0/server/unix/awpstXYZ.tgz | tar xf -
  ./start-server

  NOTE: Replace "XYZ" with your P5 version.
  NOTE: On Solaris, you'd have to use GNU gzip/gunzip utilities

  ### For MacOSX/Windows servers

  # Software is distributed as an installer package, so you simply 
  # need to double-click on the package file.
   
Installation of P5 including system requirements is explained in
more detail in section 3 of the P5 online documentation.


2. Uninstalling the software
----------------------------

If you'd like to remove P5 from your system, for whatever reason,
just follow these simple steps: 

  i. Stop the running P5 server (if any) with "stop-server" script

  i. Uninstall the software by running "uninstall.sh" script

  i. Delete the directory holding P5 software 

You need to perform those steps as privilieged user (administrator, root):

  /usr/local/aw/stop-server
  sh /usr/local/aw/uninstall.sh
  rm -rf /usr/local/aw
